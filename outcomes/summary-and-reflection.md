# Workshop Summary and Reflection

At the end of the day, we asked each participant to summarize their key
take aways from the workshop.

* Companies that want great designers should align its values with good design
* Surprised to see how many of the needed design skills are potentially not
  teachable.  Can this be improved?
* I took away many good ideas on how to identify potential designers
* You can embed design growth in an agile process, such as postmortems and
  technical post-mortems + ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
* There is reasonable agreement on the books that comprise the canon in software
  design
  * Some pointed out that the list is too long.  Can it be distilled further?
* How do I rationalize and convince the group about design decisions?
* If I have coworkers who only care about getting raises or writing papers
  then I need to tell them how the design decision will help them accomplish
  their goals.
* Let them burn their hands on the stove.
* Create opportunities for upcoming designers to have diverse experiences.
  * both positive and negative reinforcement are needed for growth.
* The paradigm of architecture as risk reduction hasn't take root yet and
  there is work to be done.
* I have a list of concrete ways to grow great designers and exchange experiences
* Surprised that there is no repository of architecture.  Code + text
* Great design is a creative art, not an engineering exercise.
* You can grow as a designer through the canon of design knowledge
* Several designers in our group expressed tha their work as designers has
  become overwhelming.  Current processes and values in companies are contributing
  factors.
  * Are we approaching a design crisis?
  * What is the dynamic here?  It might start with low level design abilities,
    putting more load on the senior designers.
